# Daily Progress

## Warm-Up Tasks 
- **23 May 2016**: Got set up with Coroutines. Hooked up both IntelliJ and SBT on multiple machines. Learned a lot about Java Bytecode and the JRE trying to figure out why [this version of boxing-tests.scala](https://github.com/storm-enroute/coroutines/blob/487e58d0cc2b85e0b4253d1b7baf70bb01c11241/src/test/scala/org/coroutines/boxing-tests.scala) still has a value boxed. I think I may be onto the solution, and will pursue it tomorrow. 

- **24 May 2016**: Looked through the Java bytecode more. Had to learn to read through bytecode and mentally translate that to a place in the codebase. Was super hard, but it was also super rewarding to see some of the Scala / Java internals. Got a lot more adept at using `javap` to understand the structure of a Java program. Couldn't figure out the boxing issue, but looked through the [fixing commit](https://github.com/storm-enroute/coroutines/commit/008db410f07d28b4e0d05e9169be7e5289468793) and understood it.

- **25 May 2016**: Dove deeper into Coroutines by looking through and understanding its tests. I got a much better feel for the specialization (and lack thereof) of different parts of the project. Documented some methods inside the Frame class both for my own understanding and for the ScalaDoc API. Learned more about how Coroutines are actually implemented by looking through Synthesizer.scala and Stack.scala. Added some tests that I felt were missing, and documented others. Tomorrow I will continue to do more or less the same things I did today, except with a focus on writing new tests.

- **26 May 2016**: Documented and worked through more tests today. The Async/Await tests were probably the hardest to get a fundamental understanding of, but now I feel more ready to port tests from [Scala Async](https://github.com/scala/async) into Coroutines. Also, learned more about types both in theory and in practice. Particularly, read up on contra/co/invariance and the `@uncheckedVariance` annotation.
 
- **27 May 2016**: Today's goal was to read into the details of [this issue](https://github.com/storm-enroute/coroutines/issues/15) and port one of the mentioned tests into Coroutines. However, I had some other things to take care of today, so I did the rest tomorrow, which is an unscheduled work day. Today, I read more about how the macros are used inside both Scala Async and Coroutines. I understand the issue, and am going to port (hopefully multiple) [A Normal Form tests](https://github.com/scala/async/blob/master/src/test/scala/scala/async/run/anf/AnfTransformSpec.scala) into Coroutines. In addition, I read about synthetic values inside the JVM. I also worked on cleaning up the issues with my [first PR into Coroutines](https://github.com/storm-enroute/coroutines/pull/18). Lesson learned: always read the styleguide before committing. 

- **28 May 2016**: Ported some tests mentioned in yesterday's issue into [a new branch](https://github.com/smithjessk/coroutines/tree/add-async-tests). Potentially found a bug in the Coroutines macros; [reported it](https://github.com/storm-enroute/coroutines/issues/19). Will investigate this more tomorrow and will port more tests in. Will also re-look at the bytecode from the first puzzle.

- **30 May 2016**: Didn't end up working yesterday (29 May). Today, however, I looked more at the bytecode puzzle and, with Aleksandar's help, made some progress in understanding where the boxing was coming from. I [added more async/await tests](https://github.com/smithjessk/coroutines/commit/7b62eddcae33f2f88ef6140ab08383f4b6832774), and found some more bugs. I'm going to port more tests tomorrow. Namely, I'll add more tests from [the other Async test suite ](https://github.com/smithjessk/coroutines/commit/7b62eddcae33f2f88ef6140ab08383f4b6832774) mentioned in [issue 15](https://github.com/storm-enroute/coroutines/issues/15). 

- **31 May 2016**: Worked more through the Java Bytecode boxing problem. Finished adding the tests from [ToughType.scala](https://github.com/scala/async/blob/master/src/test/scala/scala/async/run/toughtype/ToughType.scala), and added a few from [AnfTransformSpec.scala](https://github.com/scala/async/blob/master/src/test/scala/scala/async/run/anf/AnfTransformSpec.scala). 

- **1 June 2016**: Found and documented [a macro issue](https://github.com/storm-enroute/coroutines/issues/20). Worked through understanding the cause a bit more, and started to set up an environment to debug macros. Continued porting more Async tests. Updated [my first pull request](https://github.com/storm-enroute/coroutines/pull/18) to fit the [Storm Enroute styleguide](http://storm-enroute.com/dev/styleguide/). 

- **2 June 2016**: Imported the rest of the Async tests into Coroutines. Tomorrow, I'm going to work more on understanding the Bytecode issue. I'll also work on fixing [issue 20](https://github.com/storm-enroute/coroutines/issues/20). 

- **3 and 6 June 2016**: Made [partial progress on issue 20](https://github.com/storm-enroute/coroutines/issues/20#issuecomment-224004035). Worked through some more subtleties that emerged in testing. Worked through the Bytecode issue some more. *NOTE*: This information is split over two days because, to be blunt, neither day was very productive. If I fall behind schedule, I'll work this weekend to catch up. 

- **7-24 June 2016**: During these weeks, I neglected to track my daily progress. I will try to be better about this starting on 27 June 2016. However, I still made notable progress during this time. I opened [two](https://github.com/storm-enroute/coroutines/pull/22) [PRs](https://github.com/storm-enroute/coroutines/pull/23) and worked on [a](https://github.com/storm-enroute/coroutines/issues/25) [few](https://github.com/storm-enroute/coroutines/issues/24) [issues](https://github.com/storm-enroute/coroutines/issues/20).
