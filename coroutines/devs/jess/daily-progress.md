# Daily Progress

## Warm-Up Tasks 
- **23 May 2016**: Got set up with Coroutines. Hooked up both IntelliJ and SBT on multiple machines. Learned a lot about Java Bytecode and the JRE trying to figure out why [this version of boxing-tests.scala](https://github.com/storm-enroute/coroutines/blob/487e58d0cc2b85e0b4253d1b7baf70bb01c11241/src/test/scala/org/coroutines/boxing-tests.scala) still has a value boxed. I think I may be onto the solution, and will pursue it tomorrow.
